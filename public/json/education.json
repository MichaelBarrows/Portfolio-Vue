This project has involved extracting the tweets using keywords, preprocessing the text of the tweets, labelling the tweets for sentiment and emotion automatically using a lexicon (SentiWordNet and NRC Emotion Lexicon) and evaluating five machine learning algorithms (K-Nearest Neighbours, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Linear SVM, and Naive Bayes) performance at sentiment analysis and emotion detection.<\/p>\n                    <h4>Modules studied include:<\/h4>\n                    <ul>\n                        <li>Research Preparation and Development<\/li>\n                        <li>Research Project<\/li>\n                    <\/ul>\n                ",

This was completed by evaluating two chatbot implementation methods (Chatterbot - a Python paackage and BotMan Studio - a PHP framework). I then implemented a chatbot (and a FAQ's mobile website) and conducted a usability evaluation with a questionnaire to evaluate and compare the perceived usefulness of a chatbot and a FAQ's mobile website for new students (with first year Computer Science students). Results show that the chatbot was perceived to be more useful than the FAQ's mobile website.<\/p>\n                    <div class=\"grid\">\n                        <div class=\"small-12 medium-12 large-6 xlarge-6\">\n                            <h4>Undergraduate modules studied:<\/h4>\n                            <ul>\n                                <li>Forensic Computing<\/li>\n                                <li>Legal, Social, Ethical and Professional Issues in Computing<\/li>\n                                <li>Mobile Applications and Games Development<\/li>\n                                <li>Professional Portfolio<\/li>\n                                <li>Usability Testing and Data Analysis<\/li>\n                                <li>Research Pro-Seminar<\/li>\n                                <li>Research and Development Methods<\/li>\n                                <li>Fundamentals of Web Coding<\/li>\n                                <li>Server and Client-side Scripting<\/li>\n                                <li>Web Application Development<\/li>\n                                <li>Data Driven Design<\/li>\n                                <li>Fundamentals of User Experience Design<\/li>\n                            <\/ul>\n                        <\/div>\n                        <div class=\"small-12 medium-12 large-6 xlarge-6\">\n                            <h4>Master's level modules studied include:<\/h4>\n                            <ul>\n                                <li>Advanced Data Analysis<\/li>\n                                <li>Surveying the Field: Web Development\n                                <li>Project Management<\/li>\n                                <li>Research and Development Project<\/li>\n                                <li>Research Methods<\/li>\n                            <\/ul>\n                        <\/div>\n                    <\/div>\n                ",
